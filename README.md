## 🏓 About

This is a small hobby side project I created in my free time to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve always enjoyed playing the classic ping pong video game on retro game consoles as a kid, so I thought it would be fun to recreate a simple version myself.

I originally built this a while ago as a way to practice core web development skills, and recently decided to clean it up, redesign it and share it here on GitHub. It’s not perfect, but it was a fun and valuable learning experience!
